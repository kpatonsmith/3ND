### Abstract
The internet can be a beautiful thing, but the highway that connects us to our cat memes and YouTube videos can also be the door for malicious users to gain access to our networks and resources. Because of this, network security is paramount; however, detecting these intrusions can be less than obvious to the naked eye. We suggest a machine learning approach that takes in network traffic data and labels it malicious or benign. We will be making use of the [IDS 2018 Intrusion CSVs](https://www.kaggle.com/solarmainframe/ids-intrusion-csv) and the [LUFlow Network Intrusion Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mryanm/luflow-network-intrusion-detection-data-set) data sets.
